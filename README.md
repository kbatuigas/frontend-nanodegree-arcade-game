Simple Arcade Game Clone
===============================
A project for the Grow with Google / Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree program.

Play the game here: [https://kbatuigas.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/](https://kbatuigas.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/)

This game is inspired by the classic arcade game Frogger. The objective is to move the player around the canvas and reach the water without colliding with enemy bugs.

Use the keyboard arrow keys to move your player up, down, left, and right.

Collision with an enemy bug will put the player back in starting position.

When the player has won, an option to replay the game will appear.
